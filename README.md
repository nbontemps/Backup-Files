# Backup-Files
Create backups of your files automatically: a VBS script to boost your productivity.

## Guidelines:
1. Put the CreateBackups.vbs in the folder where the file(s) you want to back up is/are.
2. Double-click on the script. If the "Backups" is not created yet, the script will create it.
